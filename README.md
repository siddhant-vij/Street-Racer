### Rules:

- The score depends on how long the race lasts: the sooner a player finishes, the higher his or her score.
- The game is over when the player hits another car or an obstacle.

- replace the scoring system: for example, add points only for accelerating.
- give the player the ability to shoot at other cars.
- add a wider variety of cars and obstacles.
- in the event of a win, move to higher levels.
